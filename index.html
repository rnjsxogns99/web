<p>Today marks the start of TPAC 2020, our 20th Technical Plenary and Advisory Committee meetings week!
The W3C Community convenes remotely for our annual all-groups meetings which is online and virtual for the first time since 2001, and will span at least three weeks. The event focuses on collaborative meetings to create momentum and collective brainstorming, and brings together W3C technical groups, the W3C Advisory Board, TAG and Advisory Committee. Because TPAC is a way to meet with others, discuss and share ideas, our attendees can hang out in the virtual TPAC lounge and open meeting rooms at any time.
